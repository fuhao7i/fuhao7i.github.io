<ul>
  <li>model.eval() will notify all your layers that you are in eval mode, that way, batchnorm or dropout layers will work in eval mode instead of training mode.</li>
  <li>torch.no_grad() impacts the autograd engine and deactivate it. It will reduce memory usage and speed up computations but you won‚Äôt be able to backprop(which you don‚Äôt want in an eval script).</li>
</ul>
